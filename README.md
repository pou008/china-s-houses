## Preprocessing
In this phase, we perform several steps to prepare our data for analysis:

  - **Fill Missing Values**: We first fill the missing values in the columns.
  - **Data Preparation**: We prepare and transform the data so that it can be analyzed effectively.
  - **Outlier Removal**: We remove data points that are considered outliers.
  - **Feature Addition**: We add two new features to our dataframe based on other columns.

## Plotting Phase
In this phase, we visualize our data to understand it better:

  - **Distance Impact Plot**: We plot the impact of distance from town on the price per square.
  - **Elevator Effect Plot**: We plot the effect of having an elevator on the price.
  - **Home Category Map**: We plot the categorized homes on the map with different colors.

## Time Series Analysis Phase
In this phase, we analyze our data over time:

  - **Price Analysis**: We analyze the price per square over time.
  - **City Trade Analysis**: We analyze the trades in the city center over time.
